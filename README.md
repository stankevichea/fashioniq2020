# FashionIQ 2020
Project inspired by the [FashionIQ 2020](https://sites.google.com/view/cvcreative2020/fashion-iq) challenge, done as a part of an "Introduction to Machine Learning" course.

### Natural Language Processing
The challenge involves extracting labels from image captions provided as sentences in english. Our approach to this problem relies heavily on [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/).
